    "Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics dealing with vector spaces. Linear algebra operations are very useful when manipulating numeric datasets. Using these operations often allows us to avoid writing explicit loops, and thus make our code more readable, more concise, and faster to execute. Linear algebra is deeply connected to vectorization but has specific mathematical properties. Many machine learning algorithms and methods are specified to be effieciently performed using linear algebra, and we will introduce a few in the following sections.\n",
